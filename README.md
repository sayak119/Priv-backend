# Priv-backend

**Priv** is a Chrome Extension that provides the user the ability to **categorize**, **summarize**, **understand** and **compare** Privacy Policies. It has a simple User Interface that gives the user the power to understand the critical aspect of privacy policies. They can select how much granularity they want in their summary or they can go for detailed one too.

We divided the privacy policy into **10** parts or clusters. They are as follows -
1. First PartyCollection/Use
2. Third-Party Sharing/Collection
3. User Choice Control
4. Data Security
5. International and Specific Audiences
6. User Access, Edit, and Deletion
7. Policy Change
8. Data Retention
9. Do not track
10. Others

This allows users to focus on certain topics in a proper manner. To further understand and capture the multidimensionality of the policies, we made use of **Named Entity Recognition** which was custom made for law and policies. We divided it into **4** parts -
1. Article
2. Court
3. Legality
4. Activity

Priv also allows users to compare the websites' privacy policies. For comparison, we have added Facebook's, Google's, Amazon's and Youtube's privacy policies with other websites. This allows users to compare how organizations use or collect their data.

It also provides users with Readability metrics, word count and Smog index. Smog Index is a measure of readability that estimates the years of education needed to understand a piece of writing.


## How to run it
Priv is divided into **2** parts-

### Backend
* Install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and select how you want to install it.
* `pip install summa`
* `pip install textstat`
* `pip install torchtext` or `pip install torchtext --upgrade`
* `pip install nltk`
* `pip install flask`
* `pip install flask-cors`
* `pip install flask_restplus`
* Visit the `Priv-backend` folder and run `export FLASK_APP=Server`.
* After this, run `flask run -h localhost -p 5000`.

Our OS was Ubuntu 18.04 and Python version was 3.6.10

The extension can be found [**here**](https://github.com/sayak119/Priv-chrome-extension)

## How we built it
First of all, our backend was built using Pytorch. The important sentences are identified using **TextRank** summarization. We made use of Summa for this. For flexibility, in the Chrome Extension, we have given the user an option to control the granularity of the sumaary. We made use of Pytorch text classification with 1 embedding layer. Using a API, we communicate the backend results to the chrome extension. The creation of pipeline was one of the most important task. We had to fine tune our model to understand terms based on policies and train them accordingly.

Readability and complexity scores of the document are calculated and assigned using textstat library which uses the Fleschâ€“Kincaid Grading method.
